# Image_Classification
Given a set of images it can classify into different categories, here i have used images of cats and dogs and hence it will be classified into any of the two categories

I have used tensorflow library to create this CNN
tf as tensorflow is an excellent library to work with CNN to allow us to work with beautiful image datasets
I used 8000 set of images (both cat and dog) to train my CNN instance
And i tested it with 2000 set of images ( both cat and dog) and got an accuracy of 84% which is great in this field
Kindly check my code
